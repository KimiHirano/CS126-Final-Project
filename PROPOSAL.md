# Project Proposal
**Overview**
A simple 2D action game similar to games like flappy bird or super mario in which the player's character has to jump over/maneuver around obstacles. All of the character's movements will be controlled by the player's voice, like in the game "Eighth Note! Don't stop". Sounds that the mic picks up will cause the character to move forward (soft sounds for just walking, loud sounds for jumping over obstacles - the louder the sound, the higher the character will jump)

**Libraries I plan to use:**
* ofxBox2d
* openFrameworks Graphics module
* openFrameworks Sound module

**Timeline:**
* By April 20:
  - [X] start basic working GUI for the game (without the voice controlled component - have it working with keyboard controls for now until I can get the voice controlled aspect to work with the game)
  
* By April 27:
  - [X] integrate the voice controlled aspect of the game
  - [X] make improvements to graphics
  - [X] have a way to keep track of different player's scores
  
* By May 2:
  - [X] clean up
